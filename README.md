# Stochastic Vector Oracle Consensus

Establish a consensus over oracles predictions that can evoluate through time.

## Global Modelization

### Statistic model

Let $M$ be the number of attributes. \
Let $N$ be the number of oracles.

Let $C = [0, 1]^M \subset \Bbb R^M$ the state space. \
Let $\Omega = C$
Let $\mu : \Omega \to $

An oracle prediction is a realization of a law $\mu$ over $C$

In this project we considers $N$ oracles predictions : $(C^N, Bor(C^{\times N}), \mu^N)$

### Example

Let say we want to do smart contracts based on the psychology of investors on Bitcoin.
We can base our analysis on the following criterions :
- Psychology of an individual can be modelized as vector of 

## Gaussian Modelization
